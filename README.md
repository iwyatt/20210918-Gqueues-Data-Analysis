## Description
A quick and dirty chart of gqueues task data for my personal use.
Started as a quick and dirty Google Colab project in 2021.
Generates a stacked bar graph plot of completed tasks where each segment of the bar graph is a category tag from my task manager, Gqueues.
Assumes there is only one tag per task. 

## How to Use
Don't use it. Its inefficient, throws lots of warnings, and the code is embarassing.

## TODO
- [x] Add gitignore
- [ ] lots of charts
